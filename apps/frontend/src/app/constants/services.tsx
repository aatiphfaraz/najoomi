                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Ilm-e-Ramal, also known as Islamic geomancy, is a sacred and intuitive science practiced for centuries by Islamic scholars and mystics. It involves interpreting patterns drawn through dots, lines, or sand — traditionally linked to divine signs — to understand life events, emotional energies, and possible outcomes.<br />
                        Often called "the knowledge of the sand," Ilm-e-Ramal was practiced by many Islamic sages for guidance in matters of life, marriage, travel, conflict, and unseen influences. It offers deep symbolic insight and a divine lens into unfolding events.

                    <p>
                        A name is not just an identity — it’s a prayer, a legacy, and a reflection of values. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) emphasized choosing names with good meaning. At Najoomi.in, we help you find the perfect name that aligns with spiritual significance, family legacy, and Islamic tradition. Naming a child is a crucial aspect of their spiritual journey, and the right name can bring blessings, guidance, and Barakah into their life.

                    <h3 className="text-[#1e293b] font-semibold">What is Ilm-e-Adad (Islamic Numerology)?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ilm-e-Adad, or Islamic numerology, is a sacred science that interprets the spiritual energy of numbers based on Arabic letters and Islamic teachings. Rooted in ancient numerological systems and the linguistic power of Arabic, this practice offers deep insight into your soul’s journey, relationships, and life purpose.<br />
                        Each number carries divine meaning—guiding your emotional, spiritual, and worldly experiences. By understanding these influences, you can make better decisions, align with your destiny, and gain clarity on your inner strengths and life challenges.

                        Istikhara is a prophetic Sunnah — a powerful dua and prayer performed by Muslims seeking divine help in making a decision. Whether it’s about marriage, business, relocation, or any major life choice, Salat al-Istikhara connects you to Allah (SWT) for spiritual clarity. At Najoomi.in, we offer confidential and guided Istikhara consultations based on authentic Islamic sources to help you feel confident in the path you choose.

                        Dreams are more than passing thoughts — they can be signs, spiritual messages, or reflections of our emotional state. In Islam, true dreams (<em>ru’ya salihah</em>) are considered a part of prophethood. At Najoomi.in, we help you understand your dreams through the lens of authentic Islamic teachings, with care, wisdom, and confidentiality.
